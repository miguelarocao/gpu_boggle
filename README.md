# gpu_boggle

An efficient GPU based Boggle solver. 

Boggle is a word game whose purpose it is to find all possible words which can be formed by travelling a given grid of letters. By using GPUs, I hope can leverage the parallelizable nature of the problem in order to provide substantial speed ups over an equivalent CPU algorithms.

## Algorithm 1: Prefix Tree and Backracking

## Algorithm 2: Single Word Recursion
